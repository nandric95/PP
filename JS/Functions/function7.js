// Write a function named calculateDogAge that:

// ●	calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
// ●	outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
// Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

// Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
// ●	Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// ●	Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".

// Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
// ●	Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// ●	Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."
